# `less` ships with a utility binary called `lesskey`.  When run, `lesskey` uses
# this source file to generate a binary at `$HOME/.less`, which is used by
# `less`'s `-k` option to set key bindings.
#
# As of `less` version 589, you no longer need to use `lesskey`.

# Note:  MacOS seems to ship with a version < 589.  You may want to `brew install less`.
